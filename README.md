## 1. Configuration

- **Python Version**: *3.12.9*
- **CUDA Version**: *12.8* 
- **PyTorch Version**: *2.5.1*
- **Torchvision Version**: *0.20.1*
- **Torchaudio Version**: *2.5.1*
- **Graphics Card**: RTX 4090, 24GB

## 2. Setup

Please refer to the documentation `README.md` from the [3D Gaussian Splatting repo](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).

## 3. Dataset

- [**Submerged3D**](https://zenodo.org/records/15482420): Our newly collected dataset, it consists of four scenes, each containing 20 RGB 720p images focusing on shipwrecks captured in the deep sea.
- **Processing your own scene**:
  - Please refer to the [Processing your own scenes](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting?tab=readme-ov-file#processing-your-own-scenes) section from 3D Guassian Splatting.
  - In order to train with the interpolated frames, the interpolated frames **must be** named with a `_to_` flag. For example: `frame001_to_frame002.jpg`.
  - The depth map are generated from [Depth-Anything-V2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2).
  - The final structure of your own scene should be like this
    ```
    <your_dataset>
    |---depthmap
    |---distorted
    |---images
    |   |---<frame000>
    |   |---<frame000_to_frame001>
    |   |---<frame001>
    |   |---...
    |---input
    |---sparse
    |---stereo
    ```
  
  **Note on Frame Interpolation**: This work does not focus on the implementation of frame interpolation techniques. Any method capable of generating intermediate frames from consecutive frames can be used. In our implementation, we use [RIFE](https://github.com/hzwer/ECCV2022-RIFE) for frame interpolation. Since our training data has a resolution of 720p, we further employ [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) for resolution enhancement to ensure consistency with the training data resolution. Similarly, as this work focuses on 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, there are no restrictions on these techniques, any method that achieves the desired functionality can be selected. 

## 4. Training Flags

### `--frame <value>`
- **Purpose**: Set a fixed weight for interpolated frames during training.
- **Type**: Float (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 1.0)
- **Default**: None (uses default weight of 0.4)
- **Note**: This flag is ignored when `--adaptive` is used.

### `--adaptive`
- **Purpose**: Enable learnable uncertainty parameters for interpolated frame weights.
- **Type**: Boolean flag
- **Default**: False
- **Note**: 
  - Original frames: Fixed weight of 1.0
  - Interpolated frames: Learnable weights updated during training
  - Overrides `--frame` setting when both are specified

### `--alpha <value>`  
- **Purpose**: Coefficient for the log uncertainty term in adaptive loss (experimental feature).
- **Type**: Float
- **Default**: None
- **Note**: Currently not actively used in loss calculation. To enable this feature:
  1. Uncomment **line 151** in [`train.py`](train.py): 
     ```python
     loss = (weight * loss) / 2 + (opt.alpha * log_uncertainty) / 2
     ```
  2. Comment out **line 152** in [`train.py`](train.py):
     ```python
     # loss = (weight * loss) / 2 + log_uncertainty / 2
     ```

### How to run

**Fixed interpolated frame weight:**
```bash
python train.py -s path/to/scene --frame 0.4 --alpha 0.1
```

**Adaptive interpolated frame weights:**
```bash
python train.py -s path/to/scene --adaptive
```
